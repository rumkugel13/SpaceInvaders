lib content needed to be linked
windowmanager needs resolution
almost forgot guiscene

need to ad mgcb file as link, then edit csproj and add MonoGameContentReference as build action, 
	remove link etc
need component in class, since componentlist is not uptodate during first update call 
	(fixed: check toadd list as well)
static velocity set during update somehow doesnt work for all aliens simultaneously
